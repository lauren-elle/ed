## [Miss Elizabeth Colwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Colwell) is the first woman designer The Graphic Arts has presented in this department. Her drawings first attracted attention in connection with the publicity of Marshall Field, and, later, her series of lettered designs for Cowan were the subject of much favorable comment among those folks appreciative of distinctive advertising.
dn inspection of Miss Colwell’s [^fn]
work on the following pages will show its suitability for commercial requirements, such as the decorative treatment of artistic brochures and booklets. The examples of lettering shown in the Cowan advertisements are exactly in keeping with the nature of that firm's business from the viewpoints of layout and style of letter employed. It has been an axiom among designers, although just why it is hard to say, that women cannot do good lettering. Miss Colwell, with many other women designers, mfl’rs direct proof to the contrary.
Her work has been favorably known among book-makers for a long time, while examples of her book—plates are to be found in every collection representing the modern idea of this interesting art. It is regrettable that more of her plates are not available for presentation in this exhibit. Miss Colwell’ s studio is at 1373 East 57th Street, Chicago.—EDiToa.
 ‘ ISS COLWELL once said to me: “ All the ele
clear cut, her arrangements dignified and full of grace, bearing always the stamp of origi nality. Some of the designs made for Cowan, reproduced in these pages, in which the dec orative result obtained with that paucity of means, the combination of the Roman and the Italic letters, are among her most successful
examples.
A page of her letters, particularly her
script, has the necessary rhythm without sac rificin that most essential uality, legibility. O the three books she lettered, one, “Songs and Sonnets,” in Italics throughout, and the selection seems particularly adapted
" ments of a good painting, _
i} etching, or wood-block print, that design, bal ance, and color, are con— tained in good initial letter."
This appreciation of the importance of perfection in little things at once explains, would seem, the evenness in execution so
consistently encountered in everything she does; an enviable quality always, but hardly to be overestimated in good designer, and
in the field of design we are to consider to the lyrical content. White space in
Miss Colwell.
In taking up individual work after certain
abundance and the only decorations,
they
amount of orthodox training in the funda
mentals of good drawing, Miss Colwell found
that she leaned to the use almost exclusively
of natural forms, rather than to the employ ment or the eye. No alien element
ment of the old-established French eighteenth century Renaissance and Gothic ideals, and in the adaptation of the leaf and flower she has been most successful.
The chief characteristic of her designs certain structural strength, and all are distin guished by rhythm of line. This especially true of the many borders in which the favored acorn so often appears, and in the loose, freely drawn scrolls.
But in the branch of letter-making that she particularly excels. Her letters are
introduced to mar the beauty and almost chastelike quality of this little book.
In “Tristram and Iseult" the double title rich in pictorial strength and detailed orna ment, particularly appropriate for this old
warld tale. Each group of lyrics started with an initial, dividing the poem into the consecutive movements required, but bar ring these the book bears that same quality of simplicity as the “Songs and Sonnets."
Miss Colwell designed the books from cover to cover, even selecting the paper and
